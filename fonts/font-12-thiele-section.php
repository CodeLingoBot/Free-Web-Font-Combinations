				<p>When I was younger, I never really was interested in Computers. OK, games like Sid Meier's Pirates!, Defender of the Crown, or To be on Top were games I loved to play on the C64.</p>
				<p>Today I run beyond tellerrand, an event for the (web) community. I do this full-time and as a one-man-band ever since it started and I love it.</p>
